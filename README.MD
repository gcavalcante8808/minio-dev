## Minio Development

A MinIO based image which allows to configure a `default` bucket and its policy when spinning a new minio server. Useful for  development purposes.

## What is MinIO?

Its a 100% opensource s3 server implementation. You can see more information here: https://min.io/

## Why this project exists?

To provide an image suited for development which means:

* Create an default bucket to work with;
* Configure bucket default permission through environment variables.

By default, you cannot create a default/initial bucket during startup (https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/4769). Instead, you need to create a 2nd service on docker-compose, an init container on kubernetes or at least use a `docker exec/kubectl exec` to configure the first bucket and its permission.

With this project, you just need to provide `MINIO_INITIAL_BUCKET` and `MINIO_INITIAL_BUCKET_PERMISSION` that will be used by the entrypoint to create the default bucket and set its permissions. 

In fact if you dont provide those environment variables, the bucket `default` with permission `none`(private) will be created anyway (More information in the #Configurations topic).

## Using Volumes

By default, the entrypoint is hardcoded to use `/data` as the exported dir; so you can just mount a volume in the `/data` location to preserve data.

## How to start

Be sure to have Docker and Docker-compose installed. After that, just download `docker-compose.yaml` available on the project and spin up the server using the `docker-compose up -d` command.

## Configurations

The following environment variables are available in addition for those used by min.io project:

| Environment Variable            | Description                                                                                                | Default Value            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| MINIO_INITIAL_BUCKET            | The name of the bucket that will be created.                                                               | "default"                |
| MINIO_INITIAL_BUCKET_PERMISSION | Permission configuration as described in:Â https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide.html#policy | "none": a private bucket |
